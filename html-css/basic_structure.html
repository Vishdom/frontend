<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->
 <!-- <!DOCTYPE is the very first thing in your HTML document.
  It's not an HTML tag, but an instruction to the browser about the HTML version being used.
  It helps the browser to render the content correctly.-->
<html lang="en">
  <!--<html is the root element of your HTML page.
  All other HTML elements (except the <!DOCTYPE>) will be nested inside this.-->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--<meta> tags: Provide metadata like character set (charset="UTF-8" is common),
    viewport settings for responsive design, descriptions for search engines, and more.-->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
    <!--<title> tag: Sets the title of your webpage,
      which appears in the browser tab and is important for SEO.-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- Link to an external CSS file -->
</head>
<body>
  <!--<body> tag: Contains all the content of your webpage that will be visible to users,-->
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>

<!--In summary: The basic HTML structure provides the essential framework for any webpage.
It tells the browser how to interpret the code and provides a place for both metadata (in the <head>) and visible content (in the <body>).
Given your experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and your preferred learning style of learning by doing,
I would highly recommend trying to type out the above example in your code editor and opening it in the browser.
Experiment with the meta tags, try adding some more content to the <body>,
and see how it changes the page!-->
